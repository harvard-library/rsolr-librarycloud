Until recently peanuts were grown in the greater part of the gulf coast region primarily for stock feeding, but now they are of commercial importance in no less than 12 Southern states. Good seed, proper preparation of the soil, frequent cultivation of the crop, proper harvesting and curing and grading the product according to standard grades are the main essentials to the realization of a profit from peanuts. Most failures have been due to the neglect of one or more of the above essentials. Many losses have resulted from the practice of windrowing the peanut vines for curing instead of stacking them around small poles. Peanuts are in increasing demands for oil manufacture and for making many other peanut products. It is always safe for the Southern farmer to grow peanuts, as every part of the crop can be used to advantage for feeding on the farm in case the market does not justify their sale. A closer working relation between growers and dealers is desirable, and the establishment of standard grades will do much towards stabilizing the industry.\"--Page [2]."},"tableOfContents":"Conditions necessary for peanut growing -- Selection and preparation of the soil -- Fertilizers -- Peanut seed and its care -- Time and methods of planting --Cultivation -- Harvesting, stacking and curing -- Picking and cleaning -- Peanuts and peanut by-products as stock feed -- Varieties of peanuts -- Value of peanuts as a money crop -- Cooperation among peanut growers -- The politics of peanut growers.","note":[{"type":"statement of responsibility","$":"W.R.
